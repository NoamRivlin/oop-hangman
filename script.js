//Create a Hangman class that represents the game logic

// getPuzzle() is a method that returns a string that represents the current state of the puzzle

// getStatusMessage() is a method that returns a string that represents the current status message of the game

// makeGuess(guess) is a method that takes a single letter as a parameter and updates the game state accordingly

// calculateStatus() is a method that updates the status property based on the current state of the game

// Define a global variable called hangman and assign it to a new instance of Hangman with a random word and a fixed number of guesses
// You can use any words you like, but make sure they are lowercase and have no special characters or numbers
// You can also use any number of guesses you like, but make sure it is reasonable for the difficulty level of your words

// Define a function called render() that updates the puzzle and status paragraphs with their respective values from hangman.getPuzzle() and hangman.getStatusMessage()

// Call render() once at the beginning of your script to display the initial state of the game to the player

// Add an event listener to the window object that listens for the "keypress" event
